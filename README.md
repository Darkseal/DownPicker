# DownPicker

DownPicker is an extremely light-weight class library for creating *DropDownList* / *ComboBox* controls for iOS that will behave like their HTML / Android counterparts.
You'll only need a standard **UITextField** and few lines of code.


## What does it do

It takes any **UITextField** already present in your code (including those added to a *Storyboard*):

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Darkseal/DownPicker/gh-pages/images/DownPicker/UITextField.base.png "Here's a standard UITextField")

and turns it into this:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Darkseal/DownPicker/gh-pages/images/DownPicker/UITextField.DownPicker.png "Here's a DownPicker control")

It's as simple as that. You only need to provide an array of data.

**NOTE**: If you don't like the *control wrapper* approach, you can also use it as a *custom control* via the included **UIDownPicker** class: read the following paragraph for more info.


## How does it work

DownPicker is basically a *control interface wrapper*, meaning that you won't use it as a control - it will use an existing UITextField control instead.
This is a good thing, because you'll be able to design, positioning and skin your UITextField like you always do, programmatically or inside a *Storyboard* UI, depending on how you are used to work. You won't change your style, as it will adapt to suit yours.

However, if you don't like the *control wrapper* pattern, you can just use it as a *custom control* using the included **UIDownPicker** class. It's entirely up to you (and very easy to install in both scenarios).


## Installation

### Using CocoaPods

DownPicker is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

`pod "DownPicker"`

### Manual Installation

Download the latest version from [this link](https://github.com/Darkseal/DownPicker/archive/master.zip), 
then unzip & drag-drop the /DownPicker/ folder inside your iOS project. You can do that directly within Xcode,
just be sure you have the **copy items if needed** and the **create groups** options checked.


## How to Use

Once you have DownPicker installed and included in your project, you can either use it as a Control Wrapper or as a Custom Control: the choice is up to you, depending on your programming style.

### As a Control Wrapper

Add (or choose) a **UITextField** you would like to transform to a DownPicker. You can use the Storyboard designer tool or do it programmatically; you can also set up constraints, custom placement/coords, font, colors and anything else you like. When you're done, open your controller's .h file and create a property for the DownPicker wrapper:

    #import "DownPicker.h";

    @property (strong, nonatomic) DownPicker *downPicker;

Then switch to the .m file and add these lines to your controller's **viewDidAppear** method:

    // create the array of data
    NSMutableArray* bandArray = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];

    // add some sample data
    [bandArray addObject:@"Offsprings"];
    [bandArray addObject:@"Radiohead"];
    [bandArray addObject:@"Muse"];
    [bandArray addObject:@"R.E.M."];
    [bandArray addObject:@"The Killers"];
    [bandArray addObject:@"Social Distortion"];

    // bind yourTextField to DownPicker
    self.downPicker = [[DownPicker alloc] initWithTextField:self.yourTextField withData:bandArray];

That's it. You can retrieve the user's choice at any time using `self.datePicker.text` or `textField.text`.

### As a Custom Control
If you'd like to use DownPicker as a custom control instead, just instantiate the included **UIDownPicker** class programmatically and attach it to your view like any other legacy UI control:

    #import "UIDownPicker.h";

    @interface YourViewController () {
        UIDownPicker *_dp;
    }
    @end

    @end
    - (void)viewDidLoad
    {
        [super viewDidLoad];
        self._dp = [[UIDownPicker alloc] initWithData:yourMutableArray];
        [self.view addSubview:self._dp]; 
    }
    
You can then customize it using the inner DownPicker public property.

## Status Change event handling
You can bind your own delegate function to DownPicker's status change by using the `UIControlEventValueChanged` Control action in the following way:

    [self.yourDownPicker addTarget:self 
        action:@selector(dp_Selected:)
        forControlEvents:UIControlEventValueChanged];

and then:

    -(void)dp_Selected:(id)dp {
        NSString* selectedValue = [self.youtDownPicker text];
        // do what you want
    }


## Additional Features

You can also:
- defer data loading using the `[self.downPicker setData:array]` method.
- disable the right arrow image using the `[self.downPicker showArrowImage:bool]` method.
- use a custom right arrow image using the `[self.downPicker setArrowImage:UIImage*]` method. 
You can use `[UIImage imageNamed:@"yourCustomImage.png"]` to set any image in your project.
- configure (and/or localize) the placeholder text string using the `[self.downPicker setPlaceholder:NSString*]` and `[self.downPicker setPlaceholderWhileSelecting:NSString]` methods.
- retrieve, customize and hook on the inner **UIPickerView** control using the `[self.downPicker getPickerView]` method (use at your own risk).
- retrieve, customize and hook on the inner **UITextField** control using the `[self.downPicker getTextField]` method (use at your own risk). Remember that it's the exact same control you passed, so you might prefer to use your main reference instead.
- the cancel button can be removed if the boolean flag property `shouldDisplayCancelButton` is set to `NO` after DownPicker is instantiated
- the textField is updated with the value of the current scroll position only when the `Done` button is pressed if the boolean flag property `updateTextFieldValueOnlyWhenDonePressed` is set to `YES` after DownPicker is instantiated

## Upcoming Features

- More customization options (give me your suggestions).
- Dynamic data-binding.
... and more!
